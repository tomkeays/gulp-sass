# Gulp-Sass

A quick framework for working in Sass. I modeled mine after Hugo Giraudel's article, "[A Simple Gulpâ€™y Workflow For Sass](http://www.sitepoint.com/simple-gulpy-workflow-sass/)," with additional ideas from Kasey Bracey's "[The Command Line for Web Design: Automation with Gulp](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-command-line-for-web-design-automation-with-gulp--cms-23642)."

I want to merge this with some other production tools, so the Gulpfile.js configuration will additionally incorporate Bower components such as Bootstrap and FontAwesome.
